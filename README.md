# Would You Rather Project

I'm using vitejs.dev for create project

## Technologies used:
-   React
-   Redux
-   Redux-Saga
-   Redux-Toolkit
-   React Router
-   React-Bootstrap


## To run it locally:

-   install all project dependencies with `npm install`
-   start the app with with `npm run dev`
    ( Runs the app in the development mode.)<br>
-   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
